# website-angular
My SPA website that has no page refreshes, with .NET Core running the backend, and Angular running the frontend. I made this in preparation for my first internship, to learn Angular, the SPA concept, and the Model-View-Controller paradigm. It has an account system, with todo-lists and messaging, and a simple typescript implementation of tic-tac-toe.
